## Testing the Obstacle Enable/Disable Feature

This documents the test of the new obstacle enable/disable functionality.

### What was implemented:
1. **UI Changes**: Added a checkbox "Enable Obstacle" in the UI (mainwindow.ui)
2. **Backend Logic**: Added GLWindow::setObstacleEnabled() method to control both:
   - Visual rendering of the obstacle (obstacle visibility)
   - Collision detection with the obstacle (boid avoidance behavior)
3. **Connection**: Connected the UI checkbox to the backend via Qt's slot mechanism

### Test Steps:
1. **Launch the application**: Run `./release/bin/flock.exe`
2. **Observe initial state**: 
   - The obstacle should be visible (rendered as a sphere)
   - Boids should avoid the obstacle (collision detection enabled)
   - The "Enable Obstacle" checkbox should be checked by default
3. **Toggle the checkbox OFF**:
   - The obstacle should disappear from the render
   - Boids should ignore the obstacle (pass through where it was)
4. **Toggle the checkbox ON**:
   - The obstacle should reappear
   - Boids should resume avoiding the obstacle

### Key Features:
- **Dual Control**: The checkbox controls both visual rendering AND collision detection
- **Real-time**: Changes take effect immediately without requiring restart
- **Performance**: When disabled, both rendering and collision checking are skipped
- **User-friendly**: Clear checkbox label and immediate visual feedback

### Implementation Details:
- **UI**: Added `m_enableObstacle` QCheckBox to the obstacle controls section
- **GLWindow**: Added `m_obstacleEnabled` boolean flag and `setObstacleEnabled()` slot
- **Flock**: Added `setObstacleCollisionEnabled()` method to control `m_checkSphereSphere` flag
- **Rendering**: Modified `paintGL()` to check `m_obstacleEnabled` before drawing obstacle
- **Physics**: Modified collision checking to respect the enabled/disabled state

### Testing Results:
✅ Build successful  
✅ Application launches correctly  
✅ UI elements are properly connected  
✅ No runtime errors  

The obstacle enable/disable feature has been successfully implemented and is ready for user testing!
